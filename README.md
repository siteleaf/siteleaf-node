**ALPHA: This is a work in progress node library for the Siteleaf v2 API.**

# About Siteleaf

Siteleaf is a smart, lightweight platform for creating and maintaining websites. We believe that content management shouldnâ€™t be hard. That you should be able to host your website anywhere you want. That websites should be able to outlive their CMS. That our tools should be simplified, not dumbed down.

# Installation

```
npm install siteleaf
```

# Usage

```js
var Siteleaf = require('siteleaf')

var client = new Siteleaf({
  apiKey: "YOUR SITELEAF API KEY HERE",
  apiSecret: "YOUR SITELEAF API SECRET HERE"
});
```

(Access your API keys from your [Siteleaf account page](https://manage.siteleaf.com/account))

All requests are made using the [`request-promise`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request-promise) package, therefore **all requests return a Promise with the response as the first argument.**

## request(path, params)

A generic method for making Siteleaf API requests:

GET requests:

```js
client.request(`sites/${config.site_id}/pages`, {
  qs: { per_page: 50 }
}).then(function (pages) {
  console.log(pages);
});
```

POST/PUT requests:

```js
client.request(`sites/${config.site_id}/pages`, {
  method: 'POST',
  body: {
    body: "Hello world",
    title: "Example",
    path: "example",
    metadata: {
      colors: ["Red", "Green", "Blue"]
    }
  }
}).then(function (page) {
  console.log("Created page with slug: %s", page.slug);
});
```

DELETE requests:

```js
client.request(`pages/${page.id}`, { method: 'DELETE' });
```
